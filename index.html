<p>For this image, I used these shapes and colors via Adobe Illustrator to add and put emphasis on my videogame collage I made on Photoshop. The cutting/shaping of the squares into hearts combined with utilizing the color red made for a very classic retro gamer feel. When I added the pixelization effect and changed one of the hearts filling to transparency (as to give off the appearance of a lost life), I felt like it all really came together and paired well. When attaching it to the actual collage, I did also downsize it significantly for aesthetic purposes and also added a couple blending effects and filters to it to make it fit better in the image.
